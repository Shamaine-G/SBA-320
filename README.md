SBA 320H - React Web Application Project

I created a quiz app that calls a pokemon api to discover what "pokemon type" you are upon completion of the quiz. A problem that I encountered was that when I clicked the results button initially, I get a "type" error in the console and then you have to click a few additional times for the result to display, however if you double click the result populates right away. I tried removing async/await and also using (.then) to no avail. Despite the issue, the app is functional. I will continue to build on it's design and functionality for my capstone.
